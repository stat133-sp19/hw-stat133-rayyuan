**Purpose of the Workout**:
This homework is about visualizing the shot data of select players on the GSW, and generating shot charts and other visualizations. We also must use this data to draw conclusions about the players' shooting abilities and effectiveness and look for patterns. Another purpose is to get us familiar with using a version control system to manage a larger project.
