## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
gsw_shot_data <- read.csv("../data/shots-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
two_pt_data <- gsw_shot_data[gsw_shot_data$shot_type == "2PT Field Goal",]
three_pt_data <- gsw_shot_data[gsw_shot_data$shot_type == "3PT Field Goal",]


grouped_2pt_data <- group_by(two_pt_data, name)
twopt_effective <- arrange(summarise(grouped_2pt_data, total = n(), made = sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes"), percentage = made/total), desc(percentage))
grouped_3pt_data <- group_by(three_pt_data, name)
threept_effective <- arrange(summarise(grouped_3pt_data, total = n(), made = sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes"), percentage = made/total), desc(percentage))
grouped_shot_data <- group_by(gsw_shot_data, name)
total_effective <- arrange(summarise(grouped_shot_data, total = n(), made = sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes"), percentage = made/total), desc(percentage))
```

## Introduction

The Golden State Warriors have established themselves as arguably the best team in the NBA. A lot of that is attributed to their three core stares, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, in particular, are known as the "Splash Brothers". Many opposing teams in the league focus their defense a lot on pressuring Curry to challenge his incredibly long range. However, Curry obviously can't score all the points, and thus an analysis of the shooting of the five Golden State Warrior starters can highlight the key locations where certain players take and make the most shots, as well as how accurate the starters are from different ranges on the basketball court. The purpose of this analysis is to explore the shooting patterns and percentages of the Golden State Warrior starters, and to create visualizations of their shooting locations. 

##Motivation

The motivation of this analysis is to provide a detailed description of the shooting locations and accuracies of the Golden State Warrior starters. It is incredibly useful to analyze the core statistics of the Golden State Warrior starter shooting, such as their shooting percentages from 2-point range, shooting percentage from 3-point range, and overall shooting percentage. This is useful to see, since even if it seems like a player makes a good amount of threes, if their shooting percentage is low, it means their efficiency from three point range is not very productive. Thus, other teams might choose to not pressure that player as much from three if he has a lower three point percentage, since if you pressure someone really far out, you spread your defense out too much. Then, another motivation is for some more visualizations and some more detailed analysis. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
